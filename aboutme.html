            In this website, we will be learning more about environmental sustainability and how to do our part in doing
            so. To start off, I will be introducing more about myself.</p>

            <dt>Rhythm Games:</dt>
            <dd>I have been a big fan of rhythm games from a young age and I enjoy playing them as I get to enjoy
              listening to my favorite songs while also being able to interact with the songs. Some examples of these
              games are Osu and Muse Dash.</dd>

            <dt>Pokemon Cards:</dt>
            <dd>I enjoy collecting Pokemon cards and opening Pokemon packs as I love the thrill of opening a pack and not
              knowing what I would get inside. I have collected a lot of cards over the past year but have been cutting
              down on it due to the cost.</dd>

            <dt>Food Lover:</dt>
            <dd>I love going around Singapore with my friends and exploring the different food options. There are many
              cuisines that I enjoy, but I particularly enjoy Japanese cuisine the most. Experiencing great food with
              great people is a precious activity to me.</dd>
